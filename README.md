# Instant

`Instant` is a collection of application boilerplates, CLI tools and NPM packages, designed to enable the rapid development and deployment of applications on the Firebase platform.

[React](#instant-react) and [Express](#instant-express) boilerplates utilise the suite of `instant` packages to enable routing, authentication/authorisation, state management, interaction with all Firebase services and more. Although the `instant` packages have been specifically tailored to work with these boilerplates, they could also be used in isolation in any project.

The [`instant-tools`](#instant-tools) CLI can be used to create new applications (by cloning the relevant boilerplate), install dependencies, and generate project files such as new React components and Redux modules.
